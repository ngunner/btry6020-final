## Project Overview

For this project, I analyzed a dataset [1] of tasting ratings of a Portuguese red wine called ‚ÄòVinho Verde‚Äô. The dataset contained 1,599 observations and 11 physicochemical properties of these wines along with a quality score ranging from 0 to 10. My goal in conducting this analysis was to investigate the ways that linear regression modeling could predict perceived wine quality using these properties. Additionally, I wanted to interpret the results in a way that might be useful for winemakers.
