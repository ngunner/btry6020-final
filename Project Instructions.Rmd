# Final Project (30 pts)

## Introduction

This final project is designed to demonstrate your mastery of linear regression techniques on real-world data. You will apply the theoretical concepts we've covered in class to a dataset of your choice, perform a comprehensive analysis, and present your findings in a professional format suitable for showcasing to potential employers.

## Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

* Apply linear regression techniques to solve real-world problems
* Demonstrate your ability to verify and address regression assumptions
* Perform meaningful feature selection and hypothesis testing
* Communicate the practical significance of your statistical findings
* Create a professional portfolio piece for future employment opportunities

## Project Requirements

### Dataset Selection

1. Choose a dataset from Kaggle
2. Your dataset must have a continuous target variable suitable for linear regression
3. The dataset should contain multiple potential predictor variables
4. Choose a dataset that interests you and has meaningful real-world applications

### Analysis Requirements
Your analysis must include the following components:

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

* Summary statistics of variables
* Visualization of distributions and relationships
* Identification of missing values and outliers
* Data cleaning and preprocessing steps


#### Regression Assumptions Verification

* Linearity assessment
* Normality of residuals
* Homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals)
* Independence of observations
* Multicollinearity assessment


#### Assumption Violation Handling

* Apply appropriate transformations when assumptions are violated
* Document your approach to each violation
* Compare models before and after corrections


#### Variable Selection & Hypothesis Testing

* Implement at least two different variable selection techniques
* Perform hypothesis tests on coefficients
* Assess model performance with metrics (R², adjusted R², RMSE, etc.)
* Validate your model using appropriate cross-validation techniques


#### Feature Impact Analysis

* Quantify and interpret the impact of each feature on the target
* Provide confidence intervals for significant coefficients
* Explain the practical significance of your findings in the context of the dataset


#### Deliverables

GitHub Repository containing:

* All code (well-documented Rmd files)
* README.md with clear instructions on how to run your analysis
* Data folder (or instructions for accessing the data)
* Requirements.txt or environment.yml file


#### Final Report (PDF) containing:

* Introduction: dataset description and problem statement
* Methodology: techniques used and justification
* Results: findings from your analysis
* Discussion: interpretation of results and limitations
* Conclusion: summary and potential future work
* References: cite all sources used


## Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on:

* Correctness of statistical analysis and procedures
* Proper handling of regression assumptions
* Quality of variable selection and hypothesis testing
* Clarity of interpretation and insights
* Organization and documentation of code
* Professional presentation of findings

## Timeline and Submission

* Release Date: May 5th, 2025
* Due Date: Wednesday, May 14th, 2025 (11:59 PM EST)
* Submission: Email your GitHub repository link and PDF report to nbb45@cornell.edu with the subject line "Final Project - [Your Name]"

## Resources

* Course materials and lecture notes
* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [GitHub tutorial](https://nayelbettache.github.io/documents/STSCI_6020/Github_tutorial.pdf) and [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) for repository setup.

## Academic Integrity
This is an individual project. While you may discuss general concepts with classmates, all submitted work must be your own. Proper citation is required for any external resources used.

Good luck with your project! This is an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and create a valuable addition to your professional portfolio.
